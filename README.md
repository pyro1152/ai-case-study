# Challenge #1: AI Company Case Study

## Overview and Origin

### Company: Apera AI

### When was the company incorporated?

***2016***

### Who are the founders of the company?

***Sina Afrooze, Armin Khatoonabadi***

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

I work in the factory automation space. This company is one of our competitors, and is sometimes difficult to compete with due to the the advantages that their technology provides them. 

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

They are funded by venture capital, and have raised 11.8M over 4 rounds of funding. The last round was recently, securing several million in August 2023.[2]
## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Aprea AI is a company focused on developing 3D robotic guidance systems. When things are in known positions in space, it’s easy for a robot to know where it needs to navigate to in order to grasp them. But if a target’s position is variable or random, robots require spatial feedback in order to perform the task that they were deployed to execute. Apera has developed an-AI-driven depth perception engine that analyzes contextual information, such as surface topography, glare, shadows, and color. This method provides engineers with a system that is, in many cases, more flexible, powerful, and robust than other players in the space.


### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Intended customers are manufacturers, specifically ones whose processes require pick-&-place operations. These operations include but are not limited to bin-picking, depalletizing, & machine tending. Globally, the global bin-pick market us valued at $1.7 Billion, is expected to grow to $5.6 billion by 2033, signifying a projected annual growth of 12.5% over the next 10 years.[4]

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Apera utilizes an AI 3D perception algorithm that differentiates them from anything else on the market. Their approach to depth perception  is to emulate the same deduction method the human brain uses to perceive depth- by analyzing the data in proxy. Shadows, glare, color, & size all play a role. Everything else on the market uses either laser triangulation, structured light imaging, or some other form of optical measurement system. This provides the advantage of flexibility, as it can work with any camera and needs no dedicated illumination. It also performs well in scenarios where traditional systems struggle, as optical measuring systems typically struggle with very shiny or clear targets.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Apera uses a deep learning algorithm to learn what customers’ parts look like, regardless of the perspective that they’re viewing them from. This methodology allows them to accommodate for variations in surface finish, changes in ambient lighting, or other naturally occurring anomalies in image quality. It also allows for parallel image capture and processing, providing the ability to achieve faster cycle times and higher throughput.

## Landscape

### What field is the company in?

Factory Automation with a concentration in robot guidance for pick-&-place applications

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 years;10 years?

In the world of robotic vision, viable 3D options are still relatively new. 2D robotic vision solutions have been around and functional for some time now, but 5 years ago 3D vision solutions were just starting to gain some traction, & 10 years ago they were virtually unheard of. Since they reached a deployable state, 3D solutions have been growing in popularity, with manufacturers across the globe beginning to adopt the technology for bin-picking and autonomously guided vehicles, or AGVs for short. These solutions have become more widely trusted due to innovations in camera tech & spatial awareness. As it related to AI, the ability to simulate spatial awareness through environmental mapping has given rise to widespread use of AGV, while depth perception and object detection has been optimized for pick-&-place types of applications. 

### What are the other major companies in this field?

>Keynece   
PhotoNeo  
Pick-it  
Solomon  
Canon  
Mech-Mind  

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Apera has made a name for themselves in the market. They have secured a notable amount of market share, which is impressive considering the giants in the space that they are competing with. There are some large manufacturers that have adopted their technology, and have done a good job of gaining notoriety in industry.


### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

Success can be measured by market share, name recognition, number of units deployed, relevance in industry, and overall reputation amongst people in the space. Given the relatively short amount of time they’ve been present in the market, they are relatively well known and have an impressive amount of brand recognition. They are growing, have formidable technology, and compete with some major players in the space. That said, they don’t have the infrastructure in place to scale at the rate that they have, and need more boots-on-the-ground to provide a level of support to keep customers content. 

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

Similar to the previous answer, they are in a market sharing space with some industry giants. They have produced a competitive product, and are recognized in industry nationwide. That said, due to their small size, it’s becoming difficult for them to keep up in the support department.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Their algorithm is very “black-box”, meaning that Apera is responsible for 100% of the image training. If a change must be made, or a new SKU added to the database, the end user has very little ability to manipulate the model. This is a point of frustration by customers, as it makes them feel helpless & at the mercy of Apera when program modifications are necessary. It also drastically slows development time, as files are constantly having to be sent back-&-forth, resulting in an inherent latency in program development & fine-tuning. My suggestion would be to configure the operating system such that customers can make recipe adjustments & additions themselves. 



### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

While it may require some training, providing them the ability to take things into their own hands will mitigate latency in program development, restore the customers’ sentiment of being in control, and most importantly lead to a higher rate of ***customer satisfaction & retention***.


### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

An additional product could look like an improved GUI to better equip the user to manipulate the software/models. Simulation software could be implemented to provide a virtual representation of how the robot & end-of-arm-tooling would interface with parts through each iteration. This would likely need to be implemented in tandem with the development of a comprehensive training curriculum, including videos, literature, & live/virtual training classes. 

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?         

They are appropriate because it would equip Apera with the tools necessary to potentially grow into a major player in the space. Until then, they will remain limited in capacity and customer reputation will continue to suffer.
